# GCU Tours

## Overview

This was a project completed as part of coursework for my university course.

The app is responsible for managing tour data. The app allows to add a new tour including
destinations visited during that tour; and, list all tours and their destinations visited.

Tours have a unique identifier (integer); tour date; tour duration in days; and, a collection of
destinations visited. Destination details include a city name and country.

The identifier is generated when a new tour is added.
